## What the Characters Know

Characters begin the adventure knowing the following facts.

_**Kryn Dynasty.**_ The Kryn Dynasty is the dominant nation in Xhorhas. It was founded by a drow queen named Leylas Kryn, who fled the Underdark and the tyrannical rule of Lolth the Spider Queen along with her disciples. The Bright Queen still rules the dynasty centuries later, and its cities contain more than just drow. Orcs, goblinoids, tieflings, humans, and many others call the cities of the dynasty their home. Countless more denizens of the dynasty are nomads who roam the wastes in clans, hunting mastodons and other Xhorhasian megafauna.

_**Jigow.**_ This coastal settlement is actually a string of villages that are home to a collection of folk from all over Xhorhas. Goblin and orc clans founded Jigow, which explains why the settlement is governed by two elders—a goblin and an orc. The Aurora Watch (the military arm of the Kryn Dynasty) maintains a presence here, under the command of a drow called Taskhand Durth Mirimm.

Townsfolk tend to be competitive, and friendly rivalries are commonplace. Most of Jigow’s residents live in a central region called the Jumble.

_**The Luxon.**_ The official deity of the Kryn Dynasty, whose symbol appears on the nation’s heraldry, is the Luxon. This mysterious divine entity of light and rebirth has granted its faithful several esoteric secrets, the greatest of which is consecution—the act of preparing one’s soul for rebirth. Through consecution, some people within the Kryn Dynasty have lived many lifetimes, often in bodies different from the ones they were first born in. In the sequence of consecution, a drow might become a goblin, then be reborn as a bugbear, then an orc, and so on—all the while gaining greater knowledge about the world through their experiences. This process has no mechanical benefit, but players can make consecution and rebirth an interesting part of their characters’ back stories.

If a follower of the Luxon who has undergone the ritual of consecution dies within 100 miles of a Luxon beacon, their soul is ensnared by it and reincarnated within the body of a random Humanoid newborn within 100 miles of the beacon.

## Character Options

### Races

The dominant races of Wildemount are **dwarves**, **elves**, **halflings**, and **humans**.

In addition to the races of the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb), Wildemount is home to many other races, including the following:

**[Aarakocra](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options#Aarakocra)**, bird-like humanoids who roost on isolated mountaintops

**[Aasimar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options#Aasimar)**, beings who gain supernatural power from the angelic spark in their souls

**[Firbolgs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options#Firbolgs)**, forest guardians who engage in peaceful methods to protect their homes

**[Genasi](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options#Genasi)**, humanoids imbued with elemental power as a result of their birth

**[Goblins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options#Goblinkin)**, outcast scavengers descended from the experiments of a dark god

**[Goliaths](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options#Goliaths)**, hulking wanderers who dwell atop the highest mountains

**[Kenku](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options#Kenku)**, accursed corvine humanoids who can speak only using mimicry

**[Tortles](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options#Tortles)**, tortoise-like humanoids with an innate connection to the sea

Even more race options appear in [Monsters of the Multiverse](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/motm "Monsters of the Multiverse"), with **bugbear**, **duergar**, **goblin**, **hobgoblin**, **kobold**, **lizardfolk**, **minotaur**, and **orc** being appropriate choices for players who want their characters to come from cultures or societies with roots in Xhorhas.

Regardless of race, players may also give their characters the [[Hollow One]] supernatural gift. 

### Subclasses

This section includes three new subclass options: the [Echo Knight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#EchoKnight) for the fighter and [Chronurgy Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#ChronurgyMagic) and [Graviturgy Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#GraviturgyMagic) for the wizard.

#### Dunamis and Dunamancy

Dunamis is the primal magical energy of potentiality and actuality, an anticipatory arcane force that helps shape the multiverse and might very well be what holds its elements together, like an infinite web of unseen tethers. Manifesting as a translucent gray energy that shimmers and drifts like an ethereal cloud of mist when gathered, dunamis darkens as it vibrates and condenses to the moment of action or invocation, manipulating fundamental aspects of reality. Those who study to control and tap into this near-invisible power can subtly bend the flow of time and space by controlling the forces of localized gravity, peering into possible timelines to shift fate in their favor, and scattering the potential energy of their enemies to rob them of their potency.

Dunamancy is an ancient, esoteric study of magic almost unknown across Exandria. Facets of dunamancy have quietly bled into the more common applications of spellcraft like an unrealized glimpse behind the curtain of creation. Mages who pursue the study of this strange and complex force call themselves dunamancers, and their interest in learning to alter the fabric of gravity, potential, and time often coincides with a hunger to understand the oldest mysteries of the cosmos.

##### Beyond the Kryn Dynasty

Although the Kryn Dynasty is responsible for the carefully guarded development and refining of dunamancy, the mysteries of this magical art have long since spread beyond the dynasty’s borders. The hidden secrets of harnessing dunamis eventually found their way into the hands of the Cerberus Assembly and have continued to slowly disseminate across all Wildemount as a result.

If you are considering a character pursuing a path involving the manipulation of dunamis, you can easily tie your story into the Kryn Dynasty and the ready access to dunamancy it provides. But you can also consider where else in the world dunamancy might have spread, and how its secrets have influenced your character’s path. You might have stumbled into a cabal of defecting Kryn expatriates who teach you their ways, or you might have been entrusted with learning such secrets as a means of fighting the Kryn with their own power. Work with your Dungeon Master and figure out a fun and logical way that your character and the mysterious power of dunamancy might have crossed paths.

In campaigns outside Wildemount, there is no factional control of dunamancy, so the implementation of this arcane discipline is entirely open. Talk to your Dungeon Master about how dunamancy might fit into their campaign, and how your character’s story could be woven into that lore.

##### Dunamis as a Martial Focus

Life is an extended series of choices. Every crossroads offers paths to different possibilities. The reality of each possible choice begins to coalesce as you approach the moment of decision, with multiple timelines humming with opportunity. Once a choice is made, one path sparks to life and continues while others fade, their energy of potentiality diffusing into the multiverse. A rare few characters learn to invoke and harness this released dunamis in the throes of battle to enhance their martial capabilities—and such warriors are uniformly feared.

#### Fighter

The fighter takes many forms in Wildemount, from the grizzled mercenary who earns their keep by the might of their blade, to the dedicated soldier who fights for the banner of their homeland, to the hearty treasure hunter whose skill with a weapon is their finest asset.

At 3rd level, a fighter gains the Martial Archetype class feature described in the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb). The Echo Knight is a new option for that feature.

[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/04-16.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/04-16.png)

Echo Knight

##### Echo Knight

A mysterious and feared frontline warrior of the Kryn Dynasty, the Echo Knight has mastered the art of using dunamis to summon the fading shades of unrealized timelines to aid them in battle. Surrounded by echoes of their own might, they charge into the fray as a cycling swarm of shadows and strikes.

###### Manifest Echo

_3rd-level Echo Knight feature_

You can use a bonus action to magically manifest an echo of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. This echo is a magical, translucent, gray image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you manifest another echo, or until you’re [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition).

Your echo has AC 14 + your proficiency bonus, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the echo to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your echo is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed.

You can use the echo in the following ways:

- As a bonus action, you can teleport, magically swapping places with your echo at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.
- When you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the echo’s space. You make this choice for each attack.
- When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your echo moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an [opportunity attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack) against that creature as if you were in the echo’s space.

###### Unleash Incarnation

_3rd-level Echo Knight feature_

You can heighten your echo’s fury. Whenever you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action, you can make one additional melee attack from the echo’s position.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

###### Echo Avatar

_7th-level Echo Knight feature_

You can temporarily transfer your consciousness to your echo. As an action, you can see through your echo’s eyes and hear through its ears. During this time, you are [deafened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition) and [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition). You can sustain this effect for up to 10 minutes, and you can end it at any time (requires no action). While your echo is being used in this way, it can be up to 1,000 feet away from you without being destroyed.

###### Shadow Martyr

_10th-level Echo Knight feature_

You can make your echo throw itself in front of an attack directed at another creature that you can see. Before the attack roll is made, you can use your reaction to teleport the echo to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the targeted creature. The attack roll that triggered the reaction is instead made against your echo.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

###### Reclaim Potential

_15th-level Echo Knight feature_

You’ve learned to absorb the fleeting magic of your echo. When an echo of yours is destroyed by taking damage, you can gain a number of [temporary hit points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to 2d6 + your Constitution modifier, provided you don’t already have temporary hit points.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

###### Legion of One

_18th-level Echo Knight feature_

You can use a bonus action to create two echoes with your Manifest Echo feature, and these echoes can coexist. If you try to create a third echo, the previous two echoes are destroyed. Anything you can do from one echo’s position can be done from the other’s instead.

In addition, when you roll initiative and have no uses of your Unleash Incarnation feature left, you regain one use of that feature.

#### Wizard

The brightest minds of Wildemount often find themselves gravitating to the ancient and dangerous study of magic. Some train for decades within the halls and towers of academies, while others learn their craft in the shadows, keeping their discoveries to themselves.

At 2nd level, a wizard gains the Arcane Tradition class feature described in the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb). Chronurgy Magic and Graviturgy Magic are two new traditions available to wizards.

[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/04-17.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/04-17.png)

Chronurgy Wizard

##### Chronurgy Magic

Focusing on the manipulation of time, those who follow the Chronurgy tradition learn to alter the pace of reality to their liking. Using the ramping of anticipatory dunamis energy, these mages can bend the flow of time as adroitly as a skilled musician plays an instrument, lending themselves and their allies an advantage in the blink of an eye.

###### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#ChronalShift)Chronal Shift

_2nd-level Chronurgy Magic feature_

You can magically exert limited control over the flow of time around a creature. As a reaction, after you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can force the creature to reroll. You make this decision after you see whether the roll succeeds or fails. The target must use the result of the second roll.

You can use this ability twice, and you regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

###### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#TemporalAwareness)Temporal Awareness

_2nd-level Chronurgy Magic feature_

You can add your Intelligence modifier to your initiative rolls.

###### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#MomentaryStasis)Momentary Stasis

_6th-level Chronurgy Magic feature_

As an action, you can magically force a Large or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. Unless the saving throw is a success, the creature is encased in a field of magical energy until the end of your next turn or until the creature takes any damage. While encased in this way, the creature is [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) and has a speed of 0.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

###### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#ArcaneAbeyance)Arcane Abeyance

_10th-level Chronurgy Magic feature_

When you cast a spell using a spell slot of 4th level or lower, you can condense the spell’s magic into a mote. The spell is frozen in time at the moment of casting and held within a gray bead for 1 hour. This bead is a Tiny object with AC 15 and 1 hit point, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage. When the duration ends, or if the bead is destroyed, it vanishes in a flash of light, and the spell is lost.

A creature holding the bead can use its action to release the spell within, whereupon the bead disappears. The spell uses your spell attack bonus and save DC, and the spell treats the creature who released it as the caster for all other purposes.

Once you create a bead with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

###### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#ConvergentFuture)Convergent Future

_14th-level Chronurgy Magic feature_

You can peer through possible futures and magically pull one of them into events around you, ensuring a particular outcome. When you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to ignore the die roll and decide whether the number rolled is the minimum needed to succeed or one less than that number (your choice).

When you use this feature, you gain one level of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition). Only by finishing a long rest can you remove a level of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition) gained in this way.

[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/04-18.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/04-18.png)

Graviturgy Wizard

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#GraviturgyMagic)Graviturgy Magic

Understanding and mastering the forces that draw bodies of matter together or drive them apart, the students of the Graviturgy arcane tradition learn to further bend and manipulate the violent energy of gravity to their benefit, and the terrible detriment of their enemies.

###### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#AdjustDensity)Adjust Density

_2nd-level Graviturgy Magic feature_

As an action, you can magically alter the weight of one object or creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The object or creature must be Large or smaller. The target’s weight is halved or doubled for up to 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell).

While the weight of a creature is halved by this effect, the creature’s speed increases by 10 feet, it can jump twice as far as normal, and it has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. While the weight of a creature is doubled by this effect, the creature’s speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

Upon reaching 10th level in this class, you can target an object or a creature that is Huge or smaller.

###### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#GravityWell)Gravity Well

_6th-level Graviturgy Magic feature_

You’ve learned how to manipulate gravity around a living being: whenever you cast a spell on a creature, you can move the target 5 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice if the target is willing to move, the spell hits it with an attack, or it fails a saving throw against the spell.

###### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#ViolentAttraction)Violent Attraction

_10th-level Graviturgy Magic feature_

When another creature that you can see within 60 feet of you hits with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to increase the attack’s velocity, causing the attack’s target to take an extra 1d10 damage of the weapon’s type.

Alternatively, if a creature within 60 feet of you takes damage from a fall, you can use your reaction to increase the fall’s damage by 2d10.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

###### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#EventHorizon)Event Horizon

_14th-level Graviturgy Magic feature_

As an action, you can magically emit a powerful field of gravitational energy that tugs at other creatures for up to 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). For the duration, whenever a creature hostile to you starts its turn within 30 feet of you, it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 force damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage, and every foot it moves this turn costs 2 extra feet of movement.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher on it.

#### Dunamancy Spells

This section presents a sampling of spells developed through the manipulation of dunamis. These spells are available to the wizard subclasses previously mentioned in this chapter, as well as other spellcasting classes with the Dungeon Master’s consent (see the “Dunamancy for Non-Dunamancers” sidebar).

> [!INFO] DUNAMANCY FOR NON-DUNAMANCERS
> 
> The esoteric powers developed and harnessed through the use of dunamis are still very much a rare and carefully guarded feature of the Kryn Dynasty in Wildemount. However, such arcana is hard to keep hidden, especially in times of war. Spies and defectors have long smuggled out the secrets of this obscure magical practice, and even now it slowly disseminates beyond Xhorhas.
> 
> Dunamancy spells are readily available to the wizard subclasses in this chapter and should not be simply added to the full spell lists of other spellcasting classes. However, the Dungeon Master can consider allowing other spellcasting classes opportunities throughout the campaign to learn a handful of dunamancy-themed spells as rewards. Perhaps the characters uncover a cache of magical contraband, among which is a couple of [spell scrolls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5418-spell-scroll), or a traveling acolyte takes some downtime with a friendly cleric character and opens their mind to some of the stranger secrets of the universe, unlocking a spell or two. There are many unique ways to bring these spells into your game without requiring any specific dunamis-wielding subclasses to be present in the adventuring party.

_8th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a shard of onyx and a drop of the caster’s blood, both of which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell creates a sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere can have a radius of up to 40 feet. The area within this sphere is filled with magical darkness and crushing gravitational force.

For the duration, the spell’s area is [difficult terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#DifficultTerrain). A creature with [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) can’t see through the magical darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it. No sound can be created within or pass through the area. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are [deafened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition) while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

Any creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 8d10 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust.

Dark Star

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#FortunesFavor)[Fortune’s Favor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/176232-fortunes-favor)

_2nd-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a white pearl worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** 1 hour

You impart latent luck to yourself or one willing creature you can see within range. When the chosen creature makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw before the spell ends, it can dismiss this spell on itself to roll an additional d20 and choose which of the d20s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the chosen creature, it can dismiss this spell on itself to roll a d20 and choose which of the d20s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled.

If the original d20 roll has advantage or disadvantage, the creature rolls the additional d20 after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#GiftofAlacrity)[Gift of Alacrity](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/176233-gift-of-alacrity)

_1st-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target can add 1d8 to its initiative rolls.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#GravityFissure)[Gravity Fissure](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/416801-gravity-fissure)

_6th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (100-foot line)

**Components:** V, S, M (a fistful of iron filings)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You manifest a ravine of gravitational energy in a line originating from you that is 100 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Each creature within 10 feet of the line but not in it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 8d8 force damage and be pulled toward the line until the creature is in its area.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#GravitySinkhole)[Gravity Sinkhole](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/416802-gravity-sinkhole)

_4th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a black marble)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A 20-foot-radius sphere of crushing force forms at a point you can see within range and tugs at the creatures there. Each creature in the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d10 force damage and is pulled in a straight line toward the center of the sphere, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible (even if that space is in the air). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pulled.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#ImmovableObject)[Immovable Object](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/416803-immovable-object)

**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch an object that weighs no more than 10 pounds and cause it to become magically fixed in place. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can move the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute.

If the object is fixed in the air, it can hold up to 4,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the object to fall. Otherwise, a creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature can move the object up to 10 feet.

**_At Higher Levels._** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or 5th level, the DC to move the object increases by 5, it can carry up to 8,000 pounds of weight, and the duration increases to 24 hours. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the DC to move the object increases by 10, it can carry up to 20,000 pounds of weight, and the effect is permanent until dispelled.

_1st-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 round

The gravity in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range increases for a moment. Each creature in the sphere on the turn when you cast the spell must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 force damage, and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no reduction to its speed.

Until the start of your next turn, any object that isn’t being worn or carried in the sphere requires a successful Strength check against your spell save DC to pick up or move.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

_3rd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (30-foot cone)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create intense pressure, unleash it in a 30-foot cone, and decide whether the pressure pulls or pushes creatures and objects. Each creature in that cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. And every creature that fails the save is either pulled 15 feet toward you or pushed 15 feet away from you, depending on the choice you made for the spell.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the cone are likewise pulled or pushed 15 feet.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 and the distance pulled or pushed increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.

_9th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 1,000 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a small, nine-pointed star made of iron)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of destructive gravitational force centered on a point you can see within range. For the spell’s duration, the sphere and any space within 100 feet of it are [difficult terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#DifficultTerrain), and nonmagical objects fully inside the sphere are destroyed if they aren’t being worn or carried.

When the sphere appears and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends, unsecured objects within 100 feet of the sphere are pulled toward the sphere’s center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible.

A creature that starts its turn within 100 feet of the sphere must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled straight toward the sphere’s center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible. A creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 5d10 force damage and is [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) until it is no longer in the sphere. If the sphere is in the air, the [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) creature hovers inside the sphere. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, ending this [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition on itself or another creature in the sphere that it can reach. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is annihilated, along with any nonmagical items it is wearing or carrying.

_8th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a crystal prism)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You shatter the barriers between realities and timelines, thrusting a creature into turmoil and madness. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it can’t take reactions until the spell ends. The affected target must also roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns; the number rolled determines what happens to the target, as shown on the Reality Break Effects table.

At the end of each of its turns, the affected target can repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the spell on itself on a success.

_5th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, taken when a creature you can see makes an attack roll or starts to cast a spell

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 round

You target the triggering creature, which must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or vanish, being thrown to another point in time and causing the attack to miss or the spell to be wasted. At the start of its next turn, the target reappears where it was or in the closest unoccupied space. The target doesn’t remember you casting the spell or being affected by it.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 5th. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other.

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a spool of platinum cord worth at least 250 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Two creatures you can see within range must make a Constitution saving throw, with disadvantage if they are within 30 feet of each other. Either creature can willingly fail the save. If either save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If both saves fail, the creatures are magically linked for the duration, regardless of the distance between them. When damage is dealt to one of them, the same damage is dealt to the other one. If hit points are restored to one of them, the same number of hit points are restored to the other one. If either of the tethered creatures is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends on both. If the spell ends on one creature, it ends on both.

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (an hourglass filled with diamond dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You target a creature you can see within range, putting its physical form through the devastation of rapid aging. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the save fails, the target also ages to the point where it has only 30 days left before it dies of old age. In this aged state, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and its walking speed is halved. Only the [wish](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2303-wish) spell or the [greater restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2129-greater-restoration) cast with a 9th-level spell slot can end these effects and restore the target to its previous age.

_2nd-level conjuration (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You flick your wrist, causing one object in your hand to vanish. The object, which only you can be holding and can weigh no more than 5 pounds, is transported to an extradimensional space, where it remains for the duration.

Until the spell ends, you can use your action to summon the object to your free hand, and you can use your action to return the object to the extradimensional space. An object still in the pocket plane when the spell ends appears in your space, at your feet.

### Backgrounds

All the backgrounds from the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb) fit perfectly into Wildemount. Additionally, though, a number of existing backgrounds can be adapted to represent specific factions in the campaign.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#AcolyteLuxonborn)Acolyte (Luxonborn)

Every acolyte is a servant of some god. But you serve the Luxon, a being that you believe transcends godhood and created the cosmos. No mere priest, you are a student of potential, for the Luxon is potentiality incarnate. Your Shelter of the Faithful feature applies to all who venerate the Luxon, and to all who practice the art of dunamancy that the Luxon bestowed upon the world.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#CriminalMyriadOperative)Criminal (Myriad Operative)

Most criminals in Wildemount are petty thieves and cutpurses who operate out of desperation. You, however, are a criminal of a higher caliber. You are a member of the Myriad, the greatest crime syndicate to ever grace the face of Exandria. You have a network of criminal contacts and allies to help you in your crimes—but you also have rivals and superiors that would gladly throw you to the wolves to save their own skins.

The Myriad has bases of operation in every major city outside Eastern Wynandir, even if those bases are made up of only two or three members. Wherever you find the Myriad, you can find temporary shelter from the law—for a price.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#SailorRevelryPirate)Sailor (Revelry Pirate)

It seems that just about everyone is a sailor on the Menagerie Coast. Plenty of pirates ply the waters of the coast as well, but none are as infamous or as organized as the mighty Revelry. If you’re a pirate of the Revelry, you serve the Plank King and return a cut of all your plunder to him on the island of Darktow.

The Revelry doesn’t take kindly to traitors and deserters, so if you count yourself a former member of that crew, you’ll want to watch your back while traveling on the Menagerie Coast. Thugs might hassle you and your allies until you even the score with the Revelry, either by paying up, submitting to imprisonment, or proving that you’re too dangerous to tangle with.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/egtw/character-options-subclasses#SageCobaltScholar)Sage (Cobalt Scholar)

The Cobalt Soul is an organization of monastic scholars dedicated to preserving knowledge and recorded history, not just across Wildemount but all of Exandria. Its operations are primarily based out of the cities of Zadash and Rexxentrum in the Dwendalian Empire, and you likely studied at one of those sites.

As a rank-and-file pupil of the Cobalt Soul, you adventure to help expand your mind. Alternatively (and with the DM’s permission), you might also take on a more specific role within the organization. Expositors are secret agents who gather information in the field, while archivists are the curators who ensure the well-being of the Cobalt Soul’s many Archives. Monks of the Cobalt Soul are enlightened scholars who lead expeditions into ancient and forgotten places, hoping to reclaim their lost knowledge and history.
