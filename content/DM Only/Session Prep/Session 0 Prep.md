##  Create a strong start

> [!QUOTE] Strong start
> You have entered the Jumble, a large district of tangled roads and single-story buildings in the town of Jigow. Throngs of people, most of them orcs and goblins, move through the streets, laughing, singing, running, and sightseeing. All are enthralled by the raucous sights and sounds of the town’s Festival of Merit.
>
You hear snippets of conversations as people pass by: a goblin mother telling her children not to go near the baby ==horizonback== tortoises, a drow guard in shining insectile armor complaining to his partner that his gauntlet was crushed by a hulking orc while ==arm-wrestling==, and a pair of young orcs in swimwear hollering as they rush toward the banks of the ==Ifolon River==.
>
All around you, colorful signs and banners point toward festival booths surrounded by cheering people. On this street alone, you can see a ==meat-pie eating contest== near a shop mounted on the back of a massive tortoise, and on the other side of the road, a banner emblazoned with the words ==“Riddles and Rhymes: Unbeatable Riddles!”== That banner points toward a three-story temple in the center of the Jumble. The town is yours to explore—where do you want to go?
