_Wondrous Item, Common_

When you use an action to trace the edge of this medal, [difficult terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#DifficultTerrain) doesn’t cost you extra movement for 1 hour. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again, and the medal becomes nonmagical.
