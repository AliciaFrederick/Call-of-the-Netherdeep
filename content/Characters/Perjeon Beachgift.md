Each time a character completes one of their three prophecy goals, they gain a reward of the DM’s determination. Any of the following rewards are suitable for completing a goal, or the DM might decide on unique rewards of the same general level:

- For the next 1d10 days, the character gains inspiration whenever they finish a long rest.
- For the next 1d10 days, the character has advantage on saving throws to avoid being [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition).
- For the next 1d4 days, the character’s weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon’s type.
