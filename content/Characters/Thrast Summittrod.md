| Family Relationship / Rival | This person believes that you murdered their sibling. Regardless of your guilt or innocence, they are out for your blood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Ally                        | You and this person were affected by powerful magic, and now you both share a telepathic connection that functions while you are within 1 mile of each other.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Fateful Moment              | While lost in a remote forest or jungle, you were saved by a [wereraven](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cm/book-of-the-raven#Wereraven). The lycanthrope believed you were destined for greatness and granted you the gift of [lycanthropy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2014/monsters-l#Lycanthropes) with your consent. |
| Favorite Food               | Dumplings—a steamed potato bread that can be served with any meal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Mysterious Secret           | I once saw a cat that seemed to be moving with a strange sense of purpose. I followed it to the dwelling of an important local elder, where it gazed through the window for an hour. Then it suddenly shook itself and raced away, as though a spell had been broken.                                                                        |
| Prophecy                    | I will speak to a dragon, live to tell the tale, and provoke the dragon’s everlasting wrath.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
